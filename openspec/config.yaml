  Tech stack: Astro 5.x (SSG) + Vue 3 islands + UnoCSS (attributify) + Nanostores + GSAP
  Deployment: Vercel
  Language: TypeScript
  Content: YAML files in src/data/ (no database, all static build-time)
  Styling: CSS custom properties for dual themes (developer / photographer), driven by data-theme attribute
  Architecture:
    - Astro owns layout; Vue components are interactive islands (client:load / client:visible)
    - Images processed via getImage() in .astro files, passed as props to Vue
    - GSAP lifecycle managed by useGsapContext composable
    - Mode state via Nanostores atom, persisted to localStorage
  Path aliases: @/* → src/*, @data/* → src/data/*, @components/* → src/components/*

rules:
  proposal:
    - Keep proposals concise and focused on a single change
    - Include a "Non-goals" section to clarify scope
  tasks:
    - Clearly note which files need to be created or modified
    - Separate Astro-side work from Vue island work when applicable
